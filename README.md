# TwitterLegacyVerifiedData
A list of all legacy verified twitter user ids and screennames. Just in case it's useful... for some reason...

@verified on twitter follows every legacy-verified account on the platform. This script uses the twitter API to download the list of users that account followed and stored them locally. Since no new accounts are going to get legacy verified anymore, this list shouldn't need to be updated.

scrape.py: the python script used to download this data from twitter
legacy_verified_ids.txt: an array of all legacy verified user ids
legacy_verified_usernames.txt: an array of tuples of verified user ids along with their usernames
